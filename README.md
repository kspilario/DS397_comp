# DS397: Advanced Computational Methods in Data Science

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my course: DS 397 Advanced Computational Methods in Data Science. This repository contains Python codes (Jupyter notebooks), datasets, and lecture slides used in class.

DS 397 is intended for PhD in Data Science graduate students at the College of Science and College of Engineering, University of the Philippines, Diliman. Pre-requisite knowledge on linear algebra, optimization theory, basic statistics, and calculus are required, as well as basic programming skills.
